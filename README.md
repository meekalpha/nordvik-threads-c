# nordvik-threads-c
An implementation of a semaphore controlling traffic (threads) crossing a bridge.

Implemented using POSIX.

The bridge has one lane, meaning cars on the bridge may only be moving in one direction. Three cars can fit on the bridge at a time. One truck can fit on the bridge at a time.
